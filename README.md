I'm keen to develop this further, check out the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/UUUBvkE2/weather-clock) and lend a hand!


# Weather Clock
## How-to in Two

1. Go to [weatherclock.matthewcanty.co.uk](http://weatherclock.matthewcanty.co.uk/ "http://weatherclock.matthewcanty.co.uk/") 
2. Know your hyper-local rain forecast

## WTF?

Yeah I guess you're mind is melting right now. You're either looking at a blank clock - which is great, no rain! - or you're looking at some blue bars.

There are two scales which dictate the forecast, colour depth and bar height (distance from edge of clock to centre.

The forecast is hyper-local, therefore it requires your device's location.

### Example 1

<img src=example1.jpg height=600 />

*It is raining heavily now, but it is dissipating. By 1345 the rain will be something like what you might call spitting.*

### Example 2

*It's just tipping it down. Mental rain for over an hour.*
